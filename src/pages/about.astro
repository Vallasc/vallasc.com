    Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Giacomo Vallorani, a software engineer with a passion for
    distributed systems. I'm always keen to try out new things and learn from
    different areas of technology. I have a particular interest in well-designed
    UX and UI, great design can truly elevate any product.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've been a Maker for over 10 years, and my journey began when I first
    encountered Arduino. It was love at first sight, and since then, I've been
    hooked on creating and experimenting with various projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also have a passion for analog photography. I own around 10 cameras and an
    enlarger, and I love the whole process of shooting, developing, and printing
    my photos independently. Itâ€™s a rewarding experience that allows me to be
    fully immersed in the creative and technical aspects of photography.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hold a bachelor's degree from the University of Pisa and a master's degree
    from the University of Bologna, both with a focus on service-oriented
    software engineering. Throughout my academic journey, I developed a solid
    foundation in building scalable, efficient systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Above all, Iâ€™m driven by curiosity and enjoy experimenting with new
    technologies to see whatâ€™s possible. Whether itâ€™s tackling a new project or
    diving into the latest trends, Iâ€™m always eager to push my knowledge
    further.
